# Super NODE

This is my personal libary for Typescript in node. It includes a lot of stuff you'd find in most Frameworks that i personally always miss in JS/TS.

READ THIS: !!The source code you need to edit is in the src subdirectory!!

To push code, do a tsc (typscript compile), and push the compiled code.






The directory structure is sadly enforced to be like this by npm, or i am just to dumb to configure it correctly lol.
