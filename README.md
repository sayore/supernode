# Super NODE

This is my personal libary for Typescript in node. It includes a lot of stuff you'd find in most Frameworks that i personally always miss in JS/TS.

## Todo

- [ ] Date functions(maybe, i know there is stuff in vanilla JS for this)
- [ ] Typecheck avail everything important
- [ ] Add the MySQL/MongoDB based Event handler
- [ ] Vector3
- [ ] Quarternion

## Building

READ THIS: !!The source code you need to edit is in the src subdirectory!!

To push code, do a tsc (typscript compile), and push the compiled code.
